Bit of fun with different algorithms.
Based on Introduction to Algorithms 4th Edition by T. Cormen, C. Leiserson, R. Rivest, and C. Stein.
## todos
- redo heap sort in C++ with a sensible `Heap` class. My `heapSort.c` solution is pretty chunky, but is almost all logic around building and handling the `Heap`
- split out a utils file with at least a reusable `printArray` function!
- currently I've just got the values to sort hard-coded, it would be nicer to either pass values from the command line or from a file (maybe use a -f or --file flag to denote file input?)
- maybe come back in some different languages: Kotlin? Dart? Rust? Zig? x86 Assembly?! Re-implementing will probably be good for remembering them if nothing else.
- if you're really bored, adding an option to make the sorts work in descending order would be a nice touch (maybe with another commandline flag, -d or --descending?)
